# Welcome to the simulation!!

This project is centered around gaining knowledge about creating artificial intelligence, applying java, and project development. The code is hosted on [github](https://github.com/IntricaciesOfSociety/CowSocietySimulation/) and a (very rough) concept can be found on [google drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/2/d/1yiUae5--9wsAH2D4SWKuIOJiESNoR_YNxJHhiJk0rek/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=104197416385618381584)

Currently this project is in slow/stagnated development. Any further development is done by Zackary Nichol

Past influencial members who worked on this project include:

Gage Miller
Caleb Hubbard
Tyson Dent
Savva Pettengill

### How this project is organized

The project is split into many different systems, sub-systems, and sub-sub-systems, so it is imperative that the complex nature of the sim's systems be broken down into sizable chunks that can be worked on by a single developer or a small group of developers. Therefore, the design is extremely important, along with the development strategy.

Weekly meetings will occur in the discord voice channel. Any important meta-project discussions will also be help in the discord channel.

The development strategy this project is using (scaled agile framework) allows for developers to be able to jump right in at any point on anything, but only if proper design principles are used! So where do you start?

### How to contribute

Find out what you want to do! Check out the roles sheet to get a feel of how you might fit in if you are looking to become a developer. This project is using a single repository model and is currently not being developed in an open-source way (although anyone can submit a pull request). 

The code, of course, is all on GitHub. Refer to the git branching model to have an explanation of how all the branches work together if you are working on code (feature branch == prototype##). Check the prototype branch to see the current prototype being worked on then find that prototype’s docs within the google drive folders and start working on a task that hasn’t already been started.

##### Large amounts of time are not required to contribute! 
You don’t even have to work on new features to contribute! Fixing bugs in the bugs list on GitHub is a great way to get your feet wet or do something quick. Bugs marked as ‘good first issue’ are generally pretty easy to solve, or easy to understand issues.

Feel like something isn’t the best it could be? optimize! Optimization is another easy way to start contributing, whether it be rewriting a comment to be more specific, reworking a data structure into something more complete, or rewriting whole methods to work better.

You don’t even have to write any code to contribute! Showing up to a weekly meeting or simply adding an idea to the concepts sheet, or creating a sprite adds a lot to the project.

Once you feel like you have a pretty good grasp on the project as a whole, if applicable, start working on tasks in the current prototype. Refer to the git branching model to be sure that you are pushing to the correct branch.

### What is a prototype?
[Prototypes documents](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Rs1H_gR5_UxQoFicDb1XFd9UOq34PbLn) hold the steps for the next level of development for the sim itself and are the blueprints for the whole project. They hold the user stories for what the specific prototype is to accomplish. The user stories are then further broken down into their dependencies and specific smaller tasks that need to be accomplished.

### Meetings?

Now defunct:

Weekly meetings will serve as a place to distribute tasks and commit to changes. Fill out the next meeting form in the meetings channel if applicable. Meetings are not mandatory for those not needing a new task, although they are strongly encouraged to attend.

### Support or Contact
Ask any main developer any question if you must. Talk to Zack somehow to talk about more project direction specific questions. Thanks!
